## Request your own USRBG
* Join this Discord Server > [Black Box](https://discord.gg/TeRQEPb), use a bot command in [#background-request](https://discord.com/channels/449175561529589761/645627516794699787/) and wait for approval.

**All requests are processed manually** by a select few theme developers (as of right now). You should expect to **wait a short amount of time before** your background **is added.**

All requests **MUST** be hosted on `i.imgur.com`, `cdn.discordapp.com`, `media.discordapp.net` or `source.unsplash.com`. Selfhosting will not be allowed, as this causes a security vulnerability when mass-distributing content to users.

## Requirements
If you are using BetterDiscord, you **MUST have a plugin by [DevilBro](https://betterdiscord.app/developer/DevilBro) running**, as **USRBG requires his [library](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/BDFDB)** for certain important data attributes. *I've been nagging zere for while to add attributes to BD natively, but for the time being this is how we have to do it.*

## How to see your banner (Choose one)

### 1. Using the Plugin

Save ![this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Strencher/BetterDiscordStuff/master/UserBackgrounds/UserBackgrounds.plugin.js) and place it in your **plugins** folder

### 2. Importing the Database

```css
@import url('https://jeffreybob720.github.io/usrbg/dist/usrbg.css');
```

This will import the USRBG database. Alone, it's simply some variables. Some of examples on how it can be utilized can be seen in the [Snippets](https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg/tree/master/snippets) folder of this repo.

Importing it is **not required if you have BDFDB.**

### 3. USRBG for Android
Install ![Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord) then download ![this](https://github.com/terabyte25/plugins/blob/builds/UserBG.zip?raw=true) plugin
